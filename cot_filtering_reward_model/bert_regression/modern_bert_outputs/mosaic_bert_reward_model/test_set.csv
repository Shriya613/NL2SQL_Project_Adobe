Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.

  - a reasoning chain (CoT) that describes how the SQL maps to NL,
  - and the final NL sentence itself.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

Output exactly in this format:

  - and the final NL sentence itself.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,
  - a reasoning chain (CoT) that describes how the SQL maps to NL,

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,
  - a reasoning chain (CoT) that describes how the SQL maps to NL,
  - and the final NL sentence itself.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,
  - a reasoning chain (CoT) that describes how the SQL maps to NL,
  - and the final NL sentence itself.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,
  - a reasoning chain (CoT) that describes how the SQL maps to NL,
  - and the final NL sentence itself.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,
  - a reasoning chain (CoT) that describes how the SQL maps to NL,
  - and the final NL sentence itself.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.

1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.

2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,
  - a reasoning chain (CoT) that describes how the SQL maps to NL,

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.

1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,
  - a reasoning chain (CoT) that describes how the SQL maps to NL,
  - and the final NL sentence itself.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.

2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.

1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

(question) the final natural-language question in one sentence
(problem_statement) A survey conducted by a local government agency aims to determine the number of households that received food assistance last year. The data is stored in a database with the following schema:

Table: `food_assistance`
- `householdID` (integer): Unique identifier for each household
- `year` (integer): Year of the assistance
- `amount` (float): Amount of assistance in dollars

To find out how many households received food assistance in the year 2020, you need to execute the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(householdID)
FROM",How many unique coaches won awards in the 1950s and had a position of 25.5?,"From 1950 to 1970, how many coaches who received more than 1 award?",0.6329869213104248,True,1,"You are an expert evaluator of reasoning chains (CoT) that explain how a SQL query is translated into natural language (NL).

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,
  - a reasoning chain (CoT) that describes how the SQL maps to NL,
  - and the final NL sentence itself.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,
  - a reasoning chain (CoT) that describes how the SQL maps to NL,
  - and the final NL sentence itself.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,
  - a reasoning chain (CoT) that describes how the SQL maps to NL,
  - and the final NL sentence itself.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,
  - a reasoning chain (CoT) that describes how the SQL maps to NL,
  - and the final NL sentence itself.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,
  - a reasoning chain (CoT) that describes how the SQL maps to NL,

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

  - a reasoning chain (CoT) that describes how the SQL maps to NL,
  - and the final NL sentence itself.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

Consequently, the question aims to extract this sentiment score difference, ensuring it aligns with the SQL execution outcome. 

question: What is the sentiment score difference between the most positively and negatively reviewed business where the review text is 'Amazing'? To determine the sentiment score difference between the most positively and negatively reviewed business where the review text is 'Amazing', could you please provide the result? The SQL query calculates the sentiment score difference by identifying the highest and lowest sentiment scores for reviews containing 'Amazing'. By sorting reviews in descending and ascending orders, it ensures the correct sentiment score difference is extracted. Therefore, the question seeks this specific sentiment score difference. 

question: What is the sentiment score difference between the most positively and negatively reviewed business where the review text is 'Amazing'? To find the sentiment score difference between the most positively and negatively reviewed business where the review text is 'Amazing', kindly provide the result. The SQL query identifies the highest and lowest sentiment scores for reviews containing 'Amazing' by sorting them in descending and ascending orders respectively. Thus, the question aims to extract this sentiment score difference, ensuring it aligns with the SQL execution outcome.
NL: What is the difference in sentiment scores between the most positively and negatively reviewed business where the review text is 'Amazing'?Human resources department at XYZ company wants to know the difference in sentiment scores between the most positively and negatively reviewed business where the review text is 'Amazing'. Can you provide it? To determine the sentiment score disparity between the top-rated and bottom-rated business with a review text of 'Amazing', we need to identify these extremes from the dataset. This involves calculating the total sentiment score for the most positive and least positive reviews associated with such comments, then finding their difference. Given the SQL query's structure, it seems to accomplish this by first sorting reviews by sentiment score in descending and ascending orders respectively, then selecting the highest and lowest sentiment scores for reviews containing 'Amazing'. The result should highlight the sentiment gap between these two extremes. Thus, the question seeks the sentiment score discrepancy between the most enthusiastic and the most disapproving business comment labeled as 'Amazing'. Based on the provided SQL, we can ascertain this difference accurately. Hence, the core inquiry is: What is the sentiment score variance between the most positively and negatively reviewed business where the review text is 'Amazing'?

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

  - a reasoning chain (CoT) that describes how the SQL maps to NL,
  - and the final NL sentence itself.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,
  - a reasoning chain (CoT) that describes how the SQL maps to NL,
  - and the final NL sentence itself.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.

1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,
  - a reasoning chain (CoT) that describes how the SQL maps to NL,
  - and the final NL sentence itself.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

Output exactly in this format:

Step 1: Briefly summarize the SQL intent and structure.
Step 2: Briefly evaluate the reasoning chain's accuracy and coverage.
Step 3: Briefly compare the reasoning and SQL to the NL sentence.
Step 4: Briefly diagnose any missing or incorrect logic.
Step 5: Conclude with an overall justification for the score.
