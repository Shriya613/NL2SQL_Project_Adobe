Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.

  - a reasoning chain (CoT) that describes how the SQL maps to NL,
  - and the final NL sentence itself.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

  - and the final NL sentence itself.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:

2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,
  - a reasoning chain (CoT) that describes how the SQL maps to NL,
  - and the final NL sentence itself.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,
  - a reasoning chain (CoT) that describes how the SQL maps to NL,

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

1. Analyze the SQL query:
   - The SQL counts employees who have worked more than 5 years.
   - It uses a WHERE clause to filter employees with more than 5 years of experience.
   - The COUNT function is used to count the number of such employees.
   - The result is grouped by a specific column (likely employee ID or name).

2. Map the schema to human-readable terms:
   - Employees table contains columns like employee_id, name, hire_date.
   - The query filters employees hired before the current date minus 5 years.
   - The result is expected to show the total count of employees meeting the criteria.

3. Formulate the question:
   - The question should ask for the total number of employees who have been with the company for over 5 years.
   - Ensure the question is clear and directly related to the SQL output.

4. Validate the question:
   - The question should be answerable by the SQL provided.
   - It should not request additional information not present in the SQL output.
   - The question should use natural language and avoid SQL-specific terms.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,
  - a reasoning chain (CoT) that describes how the SQL maps to NL,

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,
  - a reasoning chain (CoT) that describes how the SQL maps to NL,
  - and the final NL sentence itself.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,
  - a reasoning chain (CoT) that describes how the SQL maps to NL,
  - and the final NL sentence itself.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,
  - a reasoning chain (CoT) that describes how the SQL maps to NL,
  - and the final NL sentence itself.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

SELECT department_name
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_name
HAVING COUNT(employee_id) > 10;
```


To craft an appropriate question, follow these steps:

1. Parse the SQL intent:
   - The SQL selects `department_name` from the `employees` table.
   - It groups the results by `department_name`.
   - It filters the groups to include only those with more than 10 `employee_id`s.

2. Map schema semantics:
   - `department_name` represents the name of the department.
   - `employee_id` represents the unique identifier for each employee.

3. Draft the question:
   - The question should ask about departments with more than 10 employees.

4. Validate:
   - The SQL correctly selects `department_name`.
   - It groups by `department_name` and filters based on the count of `employee_id`s.
   - No additional fields are needed.
   - The question doesn't contain any SQL-specific terms or table/column names.

  - a reasoning chain (CoT) that describes how the SQL maps to NL,
  - and the final NL sentence itself.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

Output exactly in this format:

Step 1: Briefly summarize the SQL intent and structure.
Step 2: Briefly evaluate the reasoning chain's accuracy and coverage.
Step 3: Briefly compare the reasoning and SQL to the NL sentence.
Step 4: Briefly diagnose any missing or incorrect logic.

2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.

  - a reasoning chain (CoT) that describes how the SQL maps to NL,
  - and the final NL sentence itself.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

How many total employees does the department have now? To determine the total number of employees in the Human Resources department at XYZ company after hiring 5 new employees, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the initial number of employees in the department.
2. Add the number of new hires to the initial number of employees.

Let's assume the initial number of employees in the Human Resources department is \( E \).

Given:
- Number of new employees hired = 5

Total number of employees now = Initial number of employees + Number of new employees

Therefore, the total number of employees in the Human Resources department now is \( E + 5 \). To find the exact number, we would need the value of \( E \), but based on the information provided, the formula to calculate the total number of employees is \( E + 5 \).

To summarize, the total number of employees in the Human Resources department now is \( E + 5 \), where \( E \) is the initial number of employees. question: If the Human Resources department at XYZ company initially had 20 employees and 5 new hires were made, how many employees are there now in total?Human resources department at XYZ company has hired 5 new employees. How many total employees does the department have now?

To determine the total number of employees in the Human Resources department at XYZ company after hiring 5 new employees, we need to add the number of new hires to the initial number of employees.

Given:
- Initial number of employees = 20
- Number of new hires = 5

Total number of employees now = Initial number of employees + Number of new hires

Therefore, the total number of employees in the Human Resources department now is \( 20 + 5 = 25 \). question: If the Human Resources department at XYZ company initially had 20 employees and 5 new hires were made, how many employees are there now in total?Human resources department at XYZ company has hired 5 new employees. How many total employees does the department have now?

To determine the total number of employees in the Human Resources department at XYZ company after hiring 5 new employees, we need to add the number of new hires to the initial number of employees.

Given:
- Initial number of employees = 20
- Number of new hires = 5

Total number of employees now = Initial number of employees + Number of new hires

Therefore, the total number of employees in the Human Resources department now is \( 20 + 5 = 25 \). question: After hiring 5 new employees, what is the total number of employees in the Human Resources department at XYZ company?Human resources department at XYZ company has hired 5 new employees.

Given:
- Initial number of employees = 20
- Number of new hires = 5

Total number of employees now = Initial number of employees + Number of new hires

Therefore, the total number of employees in the Human Resources department now is \( 20 + 5 = 25 \). question: What is the total number of employees in the Human Resources department at XYZ company after hiring 5 new employees?Human resources department at XYZ company has hired 5 new employees.

How many total employees does the department have now? To determine the total number of employees in the Human Resources department at XYZ company after hiring 5 new employees, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the initial number of employees in the department.
2. Add the number of new hires to the initial number of employees.

Let's assume the initial number of employees in the Human Resources department is \( E \).

Given:
- Number of new employees hired = 5

Total number of employees now = Initial number of employees + Number of new employees

Therefore, the total number of employees in the Human Resources department now is \( E + 5 \). To find the exact number, we would need the value of \( E \), but based on the information provided, the formula to calculate the total number of employees is \( E + 5 \).

To summarize, the total number of employees in the Human Resources department now is \( E + 5 \), where \( E \) is the initial number of employees. question: If the Human Resources department at XYZ company initially had 20 employees and 5 new hires were made, how many employees are there now in total?Human resources department at XYZ company has hired 5 new employees.

1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,
  - a reasoning chain (CoT) that describes how the SQL maps to NL,
  - and the final NL sentence itself.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,
  - a reasoning chain (CoT) that describes how the SQL maps to NL,

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:

2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,
  - a reasoning chain (CoT) that describes how the SQL maps to NL,
  - and the final NL sentence itself.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.

You will be given:
  - a SQL query,
  - a reasoning chain (CoT) that describes how the SQL maps to NL,
  - and the final NL sentence itself.

Your goal is to judge how accurate and complete the reasoning is, and how well it justifies the NL sentence.

Focus on the following evaluation criteria:
1. Faithfulness – Does the reasoning correctly represent the logic of the SQL? Are all filters, aggregations, and clauses described accurately without hallucination?
2. Completeness – Does the reasoning mention every major SQL component (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, etc.) that contributes to the NL meaning?
3. Error Diagnosis – If parts of the SQL are missing or incorrect in the reasoning or NL, explicitly identify them.
4. Final Coherence – Is the reasoning internally consistent and does it lead naturally to a justified numeric score?

After evaluating, assign a final numeric score between 0 and 1 reflecting the overall validity and quality of the reasoning.
A perfect match (faithful, complete, no errors) should score close to 1.0; major logical errors or omissions should score near 0.0.

Be concise and to the point. Your reasoning should be no more than a few sentences.
